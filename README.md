## Problem 2 - Why  is  DFS  a  better  choice  than  BFS  when two locations are reachable from each other?
DFS is a better choice here because it may not find the shortest path, but it is able to determine that a path between two points is possible and uses less resources such as time and memory to do so. 

## Problem 3 - If there is no path from S to G, what should this difference be?
If there is no path, BFS and A* will explore all possible options and paths. Therefore the difference between nodes visited in BFS and A* are the same.
